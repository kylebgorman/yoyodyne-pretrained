Yoyodyne Pretrained provides sequence-to-sequence transduction with pretrained
transformer modules.

These models are implemented using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/),
[Lightning](https://lightning.ai/), and [Hugging Face
transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index).

## Philosophy

Yoyodyne Pretrained inherits many of the same features as Yoyodyne itself, but
limits itself to two types of pretrained transformers:

-   a pretrained transformer encoder and a pretrained transformer decoder with
    a randomly-initialized cross-attention (à la Rothe et al. 2020)
-   a T5 model

Because these modules are pretrained, there are few architectural
hyperparameters to set once one has determined which encoder and decoder to
warm-start from. To keep Yoyodyne as simple as possible, Yoyodyne Pretrained is
a separate library though it has many of the same features and interfaces.

## Installation

🚧 **NB** 🚧: Yoyodyne Pretrained depends on libraries that are not compatible
with Yoyodyne itself. We intend to [upgrade Yoyodyne to these libraries
shortly](https://github.com/CUNY-CL/yoyodyne/issues/60) but until we do, users
should install Yoyodyne Pretrained in a separate (Python or Conda) environment
from Yoyodyne itself.

### Local installation

To install Yoyodyne Pretrained and its dependencies, run the following command:

    pip install .

## File formats

Other than YAML configuration files, Yoyodyne Pretrained operates on basic
tab-separated values (TSV) data files. The user can specify source, features,
and target columns. If a feature column is specified, it is concatenated (with a
separating space) to the source.

## Usage

The `yoyodyne_pretrained` command-line tool uses a subcommand interface, with
the four following modes. To see the full set of options available with each
subcommand, use the `--print_config` flag. For example:

    yoyodyne_pretrained fit --print_config

will show all configuration options (and their default values) for the `fit`
subcommand.

### Training (`fit`)

In `fit` mode, one trains a Yoyodyne Pretrained model from scratch. Naturally,
most configuration options need to be set at training time. E.g., it is not
possible to switch between different pretrained encoders or enable new tasks
after training.

This mode is invoked using the `fit` subcommand, like so:

    yoyodyne_pretrained fit --config path/to/config.yaml

#### Seeding

Setting the `seed_everything:` argument to some value ensures a reproducible
experiment.

#### Model architecture

##### Encoder-decoder models

In practice it is usually wise to tie the encoder and decoder parameters, as in
the following YAML snippet:

    ...
    model:
      class_path: yoyodyne_pretrained.models.EncoderDecoderModel
      init_args:
        model_name: google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased
        tie_encoder_decoder: true
        ...

##### T5 models

The following snippet shows a simple configuration T5 configuration using ByT5:

      class_path: yoyodyne_pretrained.models.T5Model
      init_args:
        model_name: google/byt5-base
        tie_encoder_decoder: true
        ...

#### Optimization

Yoyodyne Pretrained requires an optimizer and an LR scheduler. The default
optimizer is Adam and the default scheduler is
`yoyodyne_pretrained.schedulers.Dummy`, which keeps learning rate fixed at its
initial value and takes no other arguments.

#### Checkpointing

The
[`ModelCheckpoint`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint.html)
is used to control the generation of checkpoint files. A sample YAML snippet is
given below.

    ...
    checkpoint:
      filename: "model-{epoch:03d}-{val_accuracy:.4f}"
      mode: max
      monitor: val_accuracy
      verbose: true
      ...

Alternatively, one can specify a checkpointing that minimizes validation loss as
follows.

    ...
    checkpoint:
      filename: "model-{epoch:03d}-{val_loss:.4f}"
      mode: min
      monitor: val_loss
      verbose: true
      ...

A checkpoint config must be specified or Yoyodyne Pretrained will not generate
any checkpoints.

#### Callbacks

The user will likely want to configure additional callbacks. Some useful
examples are given below.

The
[`LearningRateMonitor`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/api/lightning.pytorch.callbacks.LearningRateMonitor.html)
callback records learning rates; this is useful when working with multiple
optimizers and/or schedulers, as we do here. A sample YAML snippet is given
below.

    ...
    trainer:
      callbacks:
      - class_path: lightning.pytorch.callbacks.LearningRateMonitor
        init_args:
          logging_interval: epoch
      ...

The
[`EarlyStopping`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/early_stopping.html)
callback enables early stopping based on a monitored quantity and a fixed
"patience". A sample YAML snipppet with a patience of 10 is given below.

    ...
    trainer:
      callbacks:
      - class_path: lightning.pytorch.callbacks.EarlyStopping
        init_args:
          monitor: val_loss
          patience: 10
          verbose: true
      ...

Adjust the `patience` parameter as needed.

All three of these features are enabled in the [sample configuration
files](configs) we provide.

#### Logging

By default, Yoyodyne Pretrained performs some minimal logging to standard error
and uses progress bars to keep track of progress during each epoch. However, one
can enable additional logging faculties during training, using a similar syntax
to the one we saw above for callbacks.

The
[`CSVLogger`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/extensions/generated/lightning.pytorch.loggers.CSVLogger.html)
logs all monitored quantities to a CSV file. A sample configuration is given
below.

    ...
    trainer:
      logger:
        - class_path: lightning.pytorch.loggers.CSVLogger
          init_args:
            save_dir: /Users/Shinji/models
      ...
       

Adjust the `save_dir` argument as needed.

The
[`WandbLogger`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/extensions/generated/lightning.pytorch.loggers.WandbLogger.html)
works similarly to the `CSVLogger`, but sends the data to the third-party
website [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site), where it can be used to
generate charts or share artifacts. A sample configuration is given below.

    ...
    trainer:
      logger:
      - class_path: lightning.pytorch.loggers.WandbLogger
        init_args:
          project: unit1
          save_dir: /Users/Shinji/models
      ...

Adjust the `project` and `save_dir` arguments as needed; note that this
functionality requires a working account with Weights & Biases.

#### Other options

Dropout probability and/or label smoothing are specified as arguments to the
`model`, as shown in the following YAML snippet.

    ...
    model:
      dropout: 0.5
      label_smoothing: 0.1
      ...

Decoding is performed with beam search if `model: num_beams: ...` is set to a
value greater than 1; the beam width ("number of beams") defaults to 5.

Batch size is specified using `data: batch_size: ...` and defaults to 32.

There are a number of ways to specify how long a model should train for. For
example, the following YAML snippet specifies that training should run for 100
epochs or 6 wall-clock hours, whichever comes first.

    ...
    trainer:
      max_epochs: 100
      max_time: 00:06:00:00
      ...

### Validation (`validate`)

In `validation` mode, one runs the validation step over labeled validation data
(specified as `data: val: path/to/validation.tsv`) using a previously trained
checkpoint (`--ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt` from the command line),
recording total loss and per-task accuracies. In practice this is mostly useful
for debugging.

This mode is invoked using the `validate` subcommand, like so:

    yoyodyne_pretrained validate --config path/to/config.yaml --ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

### Evaluation (`test`)

In test mode, we compute accuracy over held-out test data (specified as
`data: test: path/to/test.tsv`) using a previously trained checkpoint
(`--ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt` from the command line); it differs from
validation mode in that it uses the test file rather than the val file and it
does not compute loss.

This mode is invoked using the test subcommand, like so:

    yoyodyne_pretrained test --config path/to/config.yaml --ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

### Inference (`predict`)

In predict mode, a previously trained model checkpoint
(`--ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt` from the command line) is used to label
an input file. One must also specify the path where the predictions will be
written.

    ...
    predict:
      path: /Users/Shinji/predictions.conllu
    ...

This mode is invoked using the `predict` subcommand, like so:

    yoyodyne_pretrained predict --config path/to/config.yaml --ckpt_path path/to/checkpoint.ckpt

**NB**: many tokenizers, including the BERT tokenizer, are lossy in the sense
that they may introduce spaces not present in the input, particularly adjacent
to word-internal punctuation like dashes (e.g., *state-of-the-art*).
Unfortunately, there is little that can be done about this within this library,
but it may be possible to fix this as a post-processing step.

## Examples

See [`examples`](examples/README.md) for some worked examples including
hyperparameter sweeping with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).

## Testing

Given the size of the models, a basic integration test of Yoyodyne Pretrained
exceeds what is feasible without access to reasonably powerful GPU. Thus tests
have to be run locally rather than via cloud-based continuous integration
systems. The integration tests take roughly 30 minutes in total. To test the
system, run the following:

    pytest -vvv tests
